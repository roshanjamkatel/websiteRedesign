<b><i>"I didn't have enough time", "I'll finish it later", "I had too much work"</b></i> <br><br>
These are some word we hear daily, when someone had complications in<br>
finishing work, or when someone procrastinated to start a project because of <br>
the time limit we have in our lives. Over the past few weeks I had noticed this
<br>was an issue for me as well. As much as I try to be organized, stay on task, and <br>
limit procrastination, it always comes up and changes my plans of what I <br>
wanted to accomplish in a day. For this reason, I decided to share my journey<br>
as I try to improve my productivity in life and restructure it so the hours I am<br> up, are the hours things get done.<br><br>
Now this idea didn't just come randomly to me. I was scrolling on <b>YouTube</b><br> and noticed a channel who is run my Matt D'avella. This channel consists of<br> challenges that each last for 30 days, and one video that caught my eye was <br>
<a class="inTextLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um6f90guss4">12 Habits for Life</a>. Now this video is extremely useful, and I would recommend<br> you to watch it (after reading this article) and start building your habits as I<br> do.<br><br>
Okay, so lets get straight to the point. Productivity is linked to your perception<br> of time. You could decide to spend 2 hours watching Netflix or 2 hours<br> studying, and you probably know when you pick up watching a show on<br>
 Netflix, you will have a hard time putting it down. This was also my issue, so<br> for the past few weeks I have decided to wake up at 5:30 AM every day, and as<br>
  I am still on this journey so more updates will be coming about my habit <br>
  changes( check my blog site www.blog.rjamkatel.com to stay following),<br>
   however some things that I have already learned from the few weeks of<br> waking up early is something I call <b><i>Forced Productivity</b></i>. This idea of Forced<br>
    Productivity could be applied to any aspect of someones life, whether you are<br> learning how to do photography or studying in school, these ideas are a way<br> to keep your goal in mind.<br><br><br>
  </p>
<h1 class="inTextHeading">Forced Productivity is about 2 ideas:</h1><br>

<p class="pg">
1. Waking up early with a reason<br>
2. Putting down your distractions<br><br>

Now these ideas are very generalized but they will help you produce the <br>
outcome you want to receive, but to reach that goal you have to understand<br>
 why you are doing what you are doing. For me, waking up early is a way to<br>
  start my day. When I get up at 5:30 AM I go straight to getting ready, brushing<br>
   my teeth, showering, and making a good old cup of coffee, and then I go<br>
    straight to my computer. Now this may be a point where our lives differ, but<br>
     for some context I am currently a student in college studying computer<br>
      science. Waking up at 5:30 AM has helped me start more personal projects,<br>
       and being up early where all my friends are asleep helps me stay distraction
       <br> free. However, without a reason waking up early could seem difficult. This is<br>
        where a journal of what you want to accomplish the next day is a great tool<br>
         for success, I will be posting an article about this tomorrow. So the first step<br>
          to becoming more productive, is understanding why you want to take this turn<br>
          in your life.<br><br>
Putting down your distractions seems like an easy idea on paper, but we all<br>
 know it is much harder than you think. My suggestion is to get an app that<br>
  blocks phone usage. I use an app on android called OFF Time, and this Free<br>
   app disables all your apps that could cause a distractions, including<br>
    notifications, and makes it so if you click on the app it automatically closes.<br>
     This is a great way to minimize your distractions and could help you stay focus<br>
      on your task. The Journal that I mentioned above is another great tool that<br>
       could help you eliminate distractions. With a Journal you have the ability to<br>
        write what you want to finish, and check them off when you are done. I<br>
         recommend having a friend to start your productivity goal with you as it will<br>
          force you to make sure you are marking down what you have accomplished<br>
           and will force you to actually finish them. The best way to feel like you<br>
            accomplished work is when you look at your journal at the end of the day and <br>
            see that it is complete, that you could rest and wake up the next morning with<br>
             being finish with your previous work.<br><br>
I want this blog to be a continuation of my journey and the things that I<br>
 learned and I really want you, the readers, to join me on my journey! I will be <br>
 updating my Medium account with posts weekly, and I will also be posting<br>
  them on my website (<a class="inTextLink" href="http://blog.rjamkatel.com">blog.rjamkatel.com</a>) so I recommend that you follow me<br>
   and keep updated!<br><br>

Thanks for reading, and I hope we all learn that these productivity habits can<br>
 help us reach our goals in life.<br><br>
